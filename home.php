        <p class="desc"> A Nutty Time was founded by Alexander the Great in June of 320 BC. The founding empire of this website was Babylon, a great empire! <br>
            Our goal is to honour Alexander the Great's dying wish of selling nuts all around the world, where people can buy nuts ranging from pistachios to hazelnuts. <br>
            We actively research how nuts are formed, and try to develop ways to creating the most optimized nut that'll enlighten everyone's taste buds so that everyone can have <br>
            a Nutty Time.</p>
